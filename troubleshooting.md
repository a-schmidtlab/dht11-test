# Troubleshooting DHT11 Sensor

## Attempts Made

1. **First Attempt: Adafruit_DHT Library**
   - Used Adafruit_DHT library with direct GPIO access
   - Result: Zero readings (0°C, 0%)
   - Error: Platform detection failed
   - Status: Failed
   - Reason: Library not compatible with Raspberry Pi 5

2. **Second Attempt: pigpio Library**
   - Tried using pigpio daemon for GPIO access
   - Result: Zero readings (0°C, 0%)
   - Error: Could not connect to pigpio daemon
   - Status: Failed
   - Reason: Library not fully compatible with Raspberry Pi 5

3. **Third Attempt: Direct GPIO with RPi.GPIO**
   - Used RPi.GPIO for direct pin access
   - Result: Zero readings (0°C, 0%)
   - Error: Could not determine SOC peripheral base address
   - Status: Failed
   - Reason: Library not compatible with Raspberry Pi 5's new architecture

4. **Fourth Attempt: gpiod Library with GPIO4**
   - Using gpiod for modern Linux GPIO access
   - Initially tried with gpiochip512 (wrong chip)
   - Changed to gpiochip0 (correct chip)
   - Result: Zero readings (0°C, 0%)
   - Error: Device or resource busy
   - Status: Failed
   - Reason: GPIO4 was being used by system for 1-wire interface

5. **Fifth Attempt: gpiod Library with GPIO17**
   - Using gpiod with GPIO17 instead of GPIO4
   - Added detailed diagnostic messages
   - Result: Zero readings (0°C, 0%)
   - Error: No line_info method available
   - Status: Failed
   - Reason: Library API incompatibility with Raspberry Pi 5

6. **Current Solution: lgpio Library**
   - Using lgpio library specifically designed for Raspberry Pi 5
   - Switched to GPIO17 to avoid system-reserved pins
   - Added proper timing controls
   - Added detailed error logging
   - Status: In Testing

## Current Implementation Details

1. **GPIO Configuration**
   - Using GPIO17 (Physical Pin 11)
   - Using lgpio library for GPIO control
   - Implemented proper pull-up configuration
   - Added microsecond-level timing control

2. **Timing Parameters**
   - Start signal: 18ms low
   - Response time: 40µs
   - Bit timing: 50µs base
   - High-level threshold: 70µs for bit value determination

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added detailed logging at each step
   - Implemented proper GPIO cleanup
   - Added timeout controls for each operation
   - Added checksum verification

## Known Issues

1. **GPIO Access**
   - Some GPIO pins may be reserved by system
   - GPIO4 is typically used for 1-wire interface
   - Solution: Use GPIO17 instead

2. **Timing Sensitivity**
   - DHT11 protocol requires precise timing
   - Python timing may not be precise enough
   - Added delays to reduce CPU usage
   - May need further timing adjustments

3. **Permission Issues**
   - User must be in gpio group
   - May need to run with sudo
   - Solution: Add user to gpio group and logout/login

## Hardware Verification Steps

1. **Power Supply**
   - Verify 3.3V on VCC pin
   - Check for stable power supply
   - Verify ground connection

2. **Signal Line**
   - Check DATA line connection
   - Verify pull-up is working
   - Check for interference

3. **Physical Setup**
   - Verify correct pin connections
   - Check cable quality and length
   - Ensure proper sensor orientation

## Next Steps

1. **If No Readings**
   - Check all physical connections
   - Verify power supply voltage
   - Try with shorter cables
   - Test with a different DHT11 sensor

2. **If Inconsistent Readings**
   - Adjust timing parameters
   - Add additional error checking
   - Monitor signal with logic analyzer
   - Try adding external pull-up resistor

3. **If Permission Issues**
   - Verify group membership
   - Check GPIO permissions
   - Review system logs
   - Try different GPIO pins

## System Requirements

1. **Software**
   - Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
   - Python 3.x
   - lgpio library
   - Flask for web interface

2. **Hardware**
   - Raspberry Pi 5
   - DHT11 sensor module
   - Proper wiring connections
   - Stable power supply
